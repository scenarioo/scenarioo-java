# Upload to maven central

## Snapshot

1.  You will need to specify the following properties in your `gradle.properties` located in your gradle home directory:

    ```
    signing.keyId=BDCAAE60
    signing.password=#private key goes here#
    signing.secretKeyRingFile=#secret key file goes here#
    ossrhUsername=scenarioo
    ossrhPassword=#sonatype password goes here#
    ```

2. Change the version appropriately in the `build.gradle`
3. `gradlew clean uploadArchives -Psign`

## Releases

Same steps as for snapshot releases and then promote build to maven central:
